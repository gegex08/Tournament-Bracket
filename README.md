<h1>Tournament Bracket Generator and Analyze</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Python program allows users to create and simulate a tournament bracket for a given set of teams. It prompts the user to select teams that advance through rounds and makes random selections for the simulated tournament. Additionally, it calculates the percentage of matching words between the tournament bracket information and a text file.

<h2>Features</h2>
Bracket Generation: Generates a tournament bracket based on the selected teams.
User Interaction: Allows users to make selections for advancing teams in each round.
Randomized Simulation: Simulates tournament results with random team selections.
Matching Word Percentage Calculation: Compares the tournament bracket info with a text file to calculate matching word percentages.

<h2>How to Use</h2>
Run the Python program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to select teams for each round.
The program will display the tournament bracket and a simulated winner based on random selection.
Provide a text file (named teams.txt) with relevant words for comparison.
The program will calculate the percentage of matching words between the bracket info and the file.

<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
Team Selection: Choose teams for each round until a final winner is determined.
File Input: Ensure a file named teams.txt exists in the same directory as the program.
Repeat Program: The program prompts if you want to rerun; respond with "yes" to repeat the process.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Python 3
A text file named teams.txt with relevant words for comparison

<h2>Notes</h2>
Ensure the teams' list in teams_list corresponds accurately to the teams selected in the bracket.
Make sure to provide a teams.txt file for accurate word-matching analysis.
